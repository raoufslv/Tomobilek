The past weekend 23-25 December, my team and I worked on a project to "create a web application allowing Algerians to submit their automobile sale
announcement and consult those published by other users" at the 9th edition of the training camp held by the ETIC club.

I have worked on the front-end, using React and Tailwind, which I learned at the TC.
